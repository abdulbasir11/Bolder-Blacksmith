    /* Rock generator. Generates in-game rocks based on parameters specified by game instances.
     * Rock properties include:
     *      -Hardness: How rigid and potentially brittle it is.
     *      -Cleavage: The rock's cleaving tendencies. Typically a discrete 3D geometric shape.
     *      -Luster: The rock's tendency to reflect light
     *      -Color: The color of the rock. Determined by other properties
     *      -Powder-Filament continuum: A rocks tendency to become powdery or more crystalline when granular
     *      -Texture: The natural roughness of the rock's surface. Typically determined by hardness and cleavage
     *      -Structure: The way in which the geometric forms described by the cleavage interact.
     *      -Tensile strength
     *      -Compressive strenth
     *      -Shear strength
