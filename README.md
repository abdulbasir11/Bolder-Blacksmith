# Bolder Blacksmith
### Randomized element generation game

#### What is this?
Bolder Blacksmith is a game where you're required to create the best possible metal piece for a client.
The catch is, the ores you work with are completely random!

#### How do the generators work?
Ores are built from a series of generators, as follows:
1. **the Element generator**
   * The element generator constructs individual elements, as they might appear on the periodic table
   * Goes into great detail, generating properties like number of covalent bonds, density, etc.
2. **the Mineral generator**
   * The mineral generator constructs "minerals", or a collection of generated elements.
   * Minerals are the smallest unit of an ore.
3. **the Rock generator**
   * Rocks either a group of mineral "chunks", or homogenously one mineral. They are what the player primarily works with.
  
#### What does gameplay consist of?
Provisionally, gameplay will consist of:
- Smelting
- Alloying
- Casting
- Quenching
- Striking
- Lengthening
- Edging
- Polishing

Additionally, the player will be pitted against an AI that competes with you to create the best possble metal piece.

Lastly, the player has access to a shopkeeper, where you can:
- Buy certain ore presets
- Save certain ores from previous sessions
- Craft special equipment (if it meets certain requirements)
- Evaluate various ores for insight.
