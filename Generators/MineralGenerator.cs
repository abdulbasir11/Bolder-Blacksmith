    /* Mineral generator. Generators minerals.
     * Mineral properties include:
     *      -Number of minerals. Ranges from 1-4.
     *      
     *      -Mineral distribution. Sets distributions of each
     *      mineral based on covalence and gravity, with some
     *      random modification.
     *      
     *      -Complexity. Minerals with elements with high covalence,
     *      highly geometric crystalline structures tend to be duller,
     *      but have extreme colors.
     *      
     *      -Net structure. Normalized 0-1 of sum of each structure,
     *      with 0 being crystalline and 1 being cubic.
     *      
     *      -Net deformation. Sum of all deformations.
     *      
     *      -Net density. Sum of all densities.
     *      
     *      -Net harndess.
     *      
     *      -Net pliance.
     *      
     *      -Net cleaving tendency
     *      
     *      -Net heat resistance
     *      
     *      -Net heat hardness ratio
